# SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDL) Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDL)** using **SQL**
The goal is to explore the dataset, understand its structure, identify patterns,
detect anomalies, and extract meaningful insights using SQL queries.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the dataset structure and columns
- Perform data cleaning and validation checks
- Analyze key metrics and distributions
- Identify trends, patterns, and outliers
- Answer business-style analytical questions using SQL

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains structured tabular data suitable for
SQL-based analysis.  
It is loaded into a relational database to perform exploration using
filtering, aggregation, and grouping techniques.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL
- MySQL / PostgreSQL
- GitHub

---

## Key Analysis Performed
- Row and column exploration
- Null and duplicate value checks
- Descriptive statistics using SQL
- Group-by and aggregation analysis
- Trend analysis across categories
- Identifying high-value and low-value segments

---

## Sample Questions Answered
- What are the top categories by count and value?
- How does data vary across different groups?
- Are there any unusual or extreme values?
- What patterns can be observed over time?

---

## Key Learnings
- How to perform Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL
- Writing clean and readable analytical SQL queries
- Translating raw data into meaningful insights
- Applying a structured EDL workflow used in real projects
